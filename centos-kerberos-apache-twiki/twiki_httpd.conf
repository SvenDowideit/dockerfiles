# Example httpd.conf file for TWiki.
#
# You are recommended to take a copy of this file and edit
# the paths to match your installation. Then add:
# include "/var/lib/twiki/twiki_httpd.conf"
# to the end of your main httpd.conf file.
#
# See also http://twiki.org/cgi-bin/view/TWiki.ApacheConfigGenerator
# that helps you configure Apache

# The first parameter will be part of the URL to your installation e.g.
# http://example.com/twiki/bin/view/...
# The second parameter must point to the physical path on your disk. Be
# careful not to lose any trailing /'s.

#### Change the _second_ path to match your local installation
ScriptAlias /twiki/bin/ "/var/lib/twiki/bin/"

# This defines a url that points to the root of the twiki installation. It is
# used to access files in the pub directory (attachments etc)
# It must come _after_ the ScriptAlias.

#### Change the path to match your local installation
Alias /twiki/ "/var/lib/twiki/"

# Block access to typical spam related attachments (.htm and .html files)
# Except the TWiki directory which is read only and does have attached html files.
# You should uncomment the two lines below if the TWiki is on the public Internet
#SetEnvIf Request_URI "twiki/pub/.*\.[hH][tT][mM]?$" blockAccess
#SetEnvIf Request_URI "twiki/pub/TWiki/.*\.[hH][tT][mM]?$" !blockAccess

# We set an environment variable called blockAccess.
#
# Setting a BrowserMatchNoCase to ^$ is important. It prevents TWiki from
# including its own topics as URLs and also prevents other TWikis from
# doing the same. This is important to prevent the most obvious
# Denial of Service attacks.
#
# You can expand this by adding more BrowserMatchNoCase statements to
# block evil browser agents trying the impossible task of mirroring a TWiki.
# http://twiki.org/cgi-bin/view/TWiki.ApacheConfigGenerator has a good list
# of bad spiders to block.
#
# Example:
# BrowserMatchNoCase ^SiteSucker blockAccess
BrowserMatchNoCase ^$ blockAccess

# This specifies the options on the TWiki scripts directory. The ExecCGI
# and SetHandler tell apache that it contains scripts. "Allow from all"
# lets any IP address access this URL.
